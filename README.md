## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/Barsu5489/ChekiFlix.git
cd ChekiFlix
```

### 2. Run the App Locally

You do **not** need a backend server. You can use any static server or a VS Code extension like Live Server.

#### Option 1: Using Live Server (Recommended)
- Install the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension in VS Code.
- Right-click on `index.html` and select **Open with Live Server**.

#### Option 2: Using Python's Simple HTTP Server
- Run the following command in your project directory:
  - For Python 3:
    ```
    python3 -m http.server 5500
    ```
  - For Python 2:
    ```
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 5500
    ```
- Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:5500](http://localhost:5500)

#### Option 3: Using Node.js http-server
- Install http-server globally if you haven't:
  ```
  npm install -g http-server
  ```
- Start the server:
  ```
  http-server -p 5500
  ```
- Open your browser at [http://localhost:5500](http://localhost:5500)
